My name is Ahmed Ashraf, and I work as a Software Engineer. Recently, I have developed an interest in Low-Level topics in Software Engineering and Computer Science. This is one of the reasons why I write articles on building Redis from scratch, as I am fascinated by Database Internals and Distributed Systems.
