Summary:

If you have read all the articles and reached this point, congratulations on writing the InMemory database. I hope the articles were enjoyable enough for you and clear.

The goal of writing these articles was to share knowledge and simplify information that may be difficult or unclear for anyone trying to understand Database internals and how it works and how to do something like it.

You will find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/ahmedash95/build-redis-from-scratch) and the commits are detailed and divided according to the parts of the article.

What to do next:

In the articles, we wrote a few of the commands that Redis offers. You can check other [commands](https://redis.io/commands/) and try them yourself.

We also didn't cover support for [Pipelines](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pipelining/) and how to do batching for commands, or [Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/) and how to subscribe to channels and send messages to subscribers. These are all topics you can explore and learn from.

Alternatively, you can start reading about how MySQL works, and to make it easier for yourself, you can consider reading the source code of [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), which is a simple SQL database, and start understanding the different concepts from what we have written and how it all works.
